                    <h2>On the Subject of Sorting</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">What's the point of implementing a sorting algorithm if you are going to do it manually anyway?</p>

                    <p>This module has a screen at the bottom stating an algorithm, among 5 buttons above the screen
					laid out in an offset layout, each with a 2-digit label.</p>
					
					<p><strong>The defuser must be aware that positions refer to appearances from left to right, ignoring vertical offset.</strong> For example, 1st position classifies as bottom left.</p>
					
					<p>Each label can be swapped by pressing any button - which will highlight it white - and then selecting any other button. 
					Pressing the highlighted button during this state will cancel the swap. To disarm this module, 
					swap the labels according to the algorithm until all labels have been sorted. If an invalid swap has been made, 
					the module strikes and it resets back to the original positions.</p>

					<p>*Pivot's label and current's label refer to the label present on its position.</br>For example, if pivot = 2, then the pivot's label is the 2nd position's label.</p>
					<p>**When any swap occurs, the pivot and current get swapped with each other as well. For example, if pivot = 1 and current = 5 and you have swapped those two labels, then afterwards pivot = 5 and current = 1.</p>
