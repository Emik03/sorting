                    <p class="flavour-text">What's the point of implementing a sorting algorithm if you are going to do it manually anyway?</p>

                    <p>The module has a screen at the bottom, 
					among 5 buttons above it, each with a 2-digit label laid out in an offset layout.
					To defuse this module, refer to the algorithm specified by the bottom panel and follow its instructions.</p>
					
					<p><strong>The defuser must be aware that positions refer to appearances from left to right, ignoring vertical offset.</strong> 
					For example, 1st position classifies as bottom left.</p>
